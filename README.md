## Description

This is a coding quiz based on 5 different coding related in one way or another to coding.

It consists of a start screen, 5 multiple choice coding related questions, and an end screen. 

Included is a timer counting down how long it takes to complete the quiz, a score showing your 

final score, and a place to sign your initials.

## Usage

The usage of this is to be able to take a very short quiz involving coding questions. 

They are pretty simple and stuff that all of us would know.

## Status

The status of this project is decent but could definitely use some work. 

I feel pretty confident about a lot of it; My main concerns are the lack of 

localStorage implementation but I'm still happy overall with the outcome.
