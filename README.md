## Description

This is a coding quiz based on 5 different coding

related in one way or another to coding. It consists

of a start screen, 5 multiple choice coding related

questions, and an end screen. Included is a timer 

counting down how long it takes to complete the quiz, 

and an area at the end giving you a place to put your

initals.

## Usage

The usage of this is to be able to take a very short 

quiz that involves a couple of coding related questions.

They are pretty simple and stuff that all of us would know.

## Status

The status of this project is, decent but could

definitely use some work. I feel pretty confident about 

just about all of it, except for the lack of 

localStorage implementation, and overall 

cleanliness. The high scores and initals being on

the start screen really bothers me, but I couldn't

figure out why it was happening and with time 

constraints, I had to leave it. I'm still overall 

happy with the outcome, but I wish I had just a bit

more time to work with this.
